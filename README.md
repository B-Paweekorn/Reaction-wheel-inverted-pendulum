# Reaction Wheel Inverted Pendulum Simulation

This project simulates the dynamics of a Reaction Wheel Inverted Pendulum and includes controllers such as LQR and a Bang-bang controller.

#### This project is a part of FRA333 Robot Kinematics @ Institute of Field Robotics, King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi

## Overview

The Reaction Wheel Inverted Pendulum is a complex system that combines a pendulum with a reaction wheel, this simulation implements Bang-bang controller to breing the pendulum up, then use LQR to keep it stable.

### Features

- **LQR Controller:** Stabilize the system using a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller.
  
- **Bang-Bang controller:** Implement a Bang-bang controller as a swing-up controller to bring the pendulum upright.

- **Realistic Dynamics:** The simulation incorporates realistic dynamics and parameters of a DC motor and an inverted pendulum.
