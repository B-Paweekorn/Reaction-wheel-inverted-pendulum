## Overview

The Reaction Wheel Inverted Pendulum is a complex system that combines a pendulum with a reaction wheel, this simulation implements Bang-bang controller to breing the pendulum up, then use LQR to keep it stable.

### Features

- **LQR Controller:** Stabilize the system using a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller.
  
- **Bang-Bang controller:** Implement a Bang-bang controller as a swing-up controller to bring the pendulum upright.

- **Realistic Dynamics:** The simulation incorporates realistic dynamics and parameters of a DC motor and an inverted pendulum.

**Inject** - Type the amount of torque into the box and click `INJECT` or ENTER key to inject a disturbance to the system

**Reset** - Click `RESET` to reset the system

**Plotting** - Click on the pendulum plot or the plot window to plot the data
